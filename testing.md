# Wavelength Testing

## Automated Testing

### HTML validation:  

### CSS validation:  

### JSX validation:   
All of the custom components and pages written in JSX for this project have been validated using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). Before revieving the results below, please read this important information first. As they relate to code taught in the Code Institute Moments walkthrough, I have ignored the following errors:
- Do not use array index in keys.
- 'variable' is already declared in upper scope.
- Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.
- Do not pass children as props.
- Props spreading is forbidden.
- Do not nest ternary expressions.
- Fragments should contain more than one child

Additionally, errors regarding variable names not being in camelcase have been ignored because the variables in question represent values received from the API. As a final note, this version of the project includes this line: `/* eslint-disable */` at the top of any files including these errors listed above in order for the project to run.
