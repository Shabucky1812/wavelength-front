Wavelength is a social media community for sharing music. The Wavelength website is designed to make this process fun and seamless. Like with other social media
websites, users of Wavelength can create and customise their own profiles. Authenticated users can then access all of the functionality that Wavelength has to offer.
Users can share tracks they have been enjoying and review the tracks shared by other people. Tracks can be found through a variety of convenient filters, search fields, and ordering options. Additionally, users can follow the profiles of other users to tailor their feed to their taste in music. The overall aim of
Wavelength is to provide a community environment for people to connect through music.

### Wireframes:

During the planning process of this project, the following wireframes were created (using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)) to visualize how the site should
be structured and plan how a user would traverse through the site.

1. Discover/Feed Page:
    ![Template wireframes for discover/feed page on desktop and mobile.](/documentation/readme/wireframes/discover-page.png)  
    This wireframe shows the structure of the discover page (and the feed page as the structure will remain the same with different tracks being loaded) which
    will serve as Wavelength's index page. This page will allow users to scroll through the most recently shared tracks (only those by users they follow on the feed page) as well as letting them filter the tracks by score and genre.

2. Search Page:
    ![Template wireframes for search page on desktop and mobile.](/documentation/readme/wireframes/search-page.png)  
    This wireframe shows the search page that allows the user to look for specific tracks and profiles. This makes searching for specific content quicker for a better
    overall experience.

3. Track Page:
    ![Template wireframes for track page on desktop and mobile.](/documentation/readme/wireframes/track-page.png)  
    This user will be brought to this page upon clicking on an individual track. They are shown the track in more detail as well as the reviews for the track left by other users. This is also where they will be able to edit or add their review.

4. Profile Page:
    ![Template wireframes for profile page on desktop and mobile.](/documentation/readme/wireframes/profile-page.png)  
    Users will be able to view profiles from pages based on this wireframe. The profile page will display a quick overview of the user, followed by a list of their shared tracks.

5. Sign-In/Sign-Up/Sign-Out Pages:
    ![Template wireframes for sign-in page on desktop and mobile.](/documentation/readme/wireframes/sign-in-page.png)  
    The pages for signing in, up, and out will all look similar to the sign in page mocked above and behave as you would expect them to.

## Design

### Colour Scheme:  

Wavelength uses the following colour palette, generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/):  
![Wavelength colour palette.](/documentation/readme/coolors.png)  
As Wavelength is a social media site, I wanted the colour scheme to be simple and to create a cozy, dark-mode, kind of vibe. To achieve this, the only main colour used on the site is a dark grey (Onyx - #2E3532), this colour is used as the main background colour throughout with a slightly darker shade being used as the background of certain components (e.g. navbar, tracks, reviews). For the main text of the site to have suitable contrast, I chose a cloudy white (Alabaster - #E0E2DB) which is used for most of the site's text. The remaining colours are used to add a little more interest to the site and also to subtly provide information to the user, for example active nav links remain the orange (Carrot Orange - #F18F01) shade to remind the user where they are located. The blue (Moonstone - #08B1C4) is mainly used for the Track component, as it stands out nicely against the orange.
