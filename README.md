Wavelength is a social media community for sharing music. The Wavelength website is designed to make this process fun and seamless. Like with other social media
websites, users of Wavelength can create and customise their own profiles. Authenticated users can then access all of the functionality that Wavelength has to offer.
Users can share tracks they have been enjoying and review the tracks shared by other people. Tracks can be found through a variety of convenient filters, search fields, and ordering options. Additionally, users can follow the profiles of other users to tailor their feed to their taste in music. The overall aim of
Wavelength is to provide a community environment for people to connect through music.
